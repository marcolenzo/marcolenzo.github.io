Unfortunately, it has been a very hectic week in a very busy year!

I did the wrong decision to refresh my Kubernetes cluster during the weekend. Some unexpected issues coupled with me being extremely tired and I managed to nuke my entire cluster of machines included the backups. No idea how I managed as it takes some artistry to nuke the backups as well.

All I know is that I lost at least the last year of blog posts. I have some recent backup lying in some cloud but I’m not even sure which one.

Anyway, time to start afresh then. I’ll try to recover old posts as I move along.

Talk to you soon,

Marco
