Today I will just link an article I wrote for GitLab which received quite some positive feedback. It is a new approach I took for Continuous Delivery where I leverage the GitLab tools to create and manage my pipeline. I believe this is a superior and less costly approach to building the pipeline piece by piece and maintaining it on premise. Having the possibility of relying on open source projects driven by large and healthy communities is the way to go in my opinion.<ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7149337761600559" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-slot="4280772662" style="display: block; text-align: center;"></ins>
