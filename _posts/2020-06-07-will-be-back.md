End of last year I was dishing out blog posts regularly. Then it came Christmas and I decided to wrap up some very interesting articles on Kubernetes. The problem was that I started too much at one go and eventually never completed.

Google Search was kind enough to send me an email with a report reminding me that sometimes my blogs can help a fellow colleague in trouble. So I decided I need to make sure to write something in the coming days.

Wait for it,

Marco
